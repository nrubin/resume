## Projects

### School

#### [*FitLog*](http://hfid.olin.edu/sa2013/s_engr3220-soul-patch/)

A project aimed at designing and prototyping a mobile app for personal trainers. Worked in a team of four interviewing users, designing the app, and implementing a mostly functional prototype as a web app with a Python backend. 

#### [*Lego 3D Printer*](http://ibeitia.com/lego3dprinter/)

Worked on a team of four to design and fabricate a 3-axis CNC device capable of accepting a design from a LEGO CAD program and assembling the structure. Worked on hardware interface code and electrical subsystem. 

#### *Robotic Tugboat*

Programmed a three foot long tug boat to navigate a large indoor pool, avoid obstacles, and deliver a stranded barge to safety. Sensors included a black and white overhead camera, close-range infrared sensor, and infrared signal seeker. Written in LabView.

#### [*Knots in Wikipedia*](http://www.greenteapress.com/compmod/html/thinkcomplexity014.html)

Worked with a team mate to research graph properties in Wikipedia. Wrote a Wikipedia scraper and parser that could turn individual Wikipedia HTML files into an entire graph. Published in the book Think Complexity by Dr. Allen Downey. 

### Side Projects

#### [*Planet*](https://github.com/olin/planet?source=c)
A web app that helps Olin students create their plan of study. Currently being designed and implemented with another student with a focus on maintainability and extensibility. Python backend. 

#### [*Txt2HelpMe*](https://github.com/nrubin/Txt2HelpMe?source=c)
A no-UI web app that routes texts sent from stranded Olin students to the internal assistance mailing list. Designed to assist students stranded in the subway in finding a way home. Python backend, currently in production.

#### [*Windows8Tracks*](https://github.com/nrubin/Windows8tracks?source=c)
A Windows Store app designed to act as a front-end for the music website 8tracks.com. It is designed to be simple and optimized for listening to music in the background. Written using web technologies, currently in progress.

## About Me
I was born in Israel and moved to Los Angeles, California in 1997. My interest in engineering began all the way then when I would spend hours building LEGOs, and developed further as I would disassemble my parent’s desktops and write small bash scripts to annoy my friends. I truly discovered programming in college, and since then I’ve bounced around between programming, user experience design, robotics, and electrical engineering. My diverse interests force me to learn quickly when I pick up a new project, which I tend to do often as my skills and interests diversify. I recognize that I do not have a formal background in CS, but I am driven to become a skilled and able programmer, and I believe my diverse experiences in the industry enable me to become an engineer that is conscious of technical challenges, schedules, and cultural contexts. While I’m not working on school projects or working, I love to get out there and enjoy nature through hikes. I also love organizing parties and get-togethers, and I’m known as the coordinator within my group of friends. I always stay up to date with the latest news in the industry, and I start new projects often to make sure my skills don’t fade.
